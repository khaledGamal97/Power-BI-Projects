# Marketing Campaign 


## Background:
Marketing campaigns can be of any kind. For example, a discount, getting something for free, collecting points on a membership card, free delivery, etc. 
In this case, the type of campaign doesn't matter. What matters is that different types of campaigns work better for specific clusters of customers.
